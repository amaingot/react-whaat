# What is React?
> How to learn React the Mango way.

This is the framework for a beginner React workshop loaded with all of my opinions. I'll try to list a few of my opinions below, but I'm sure you'll find more the deeper you go.

 - Typscript is the best script
 - Create React App is where it is at
 - Functional components are truly functional
 - Hooks are sharp
 - Redux is nice when app state interactions is complex
 - Eslint keeps the the fur balls away
 - Material UI components is free money, I'm materialistic

 3. Use CRA to add in a basic implementation of Redux for the login form
 4. Update tests to
 5. Add in Redux Thunks for a first pass at middleware
